food but criminalized for rejecting the cocktail of toxins contained in vaccines                       By Hamish   henrymakow com       The Establishment media has reported that there is a growing  anti vax  movement such an uptick in opposition to vaccines that the moniker  anti vaxxers  has entered the modern lexicon       In Ontario  school boards have warned parents  to update their kids  immunization records or face suspension   The provincial legislature has produced legislation that  would require anti vax parents to take an  education session  essentially a re education brainwash  The authoritarian posturing by the Establishment produces a societal chilling effect  people who either refuse vaccines or denounce them are ostracized by society and this kind of systematic shunning is a worldwide trend       In Australia  there is a  vaccine crackdown  announcing an end to religious exemptions and decreeing that  doctors will be given incentive payments so that parents stick to their children s vaccination schedule   In poorer countries  organizations like The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  the world s largest private foundation with assets in the billions  distributes vaccines to millions  Adverse consequences are rarely headlined       Major media outlets censure any expos\\xc3\\xa9 exploring the possibility of vaccine damage and corrupt Establishment collusion like the film Vaxxed  written and directed by Dr  Andrew Wakefield  that was pulled from the Tribeca Film Festival  Celebrity Hollywood stars are scorned like Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy for expressing concerns about vaccine safety  Even Donald Trump has stated that vaccines are  not helpful  and in turn has been ridiculed by the corporate media  Of course  Dr  Oz  the darling of that same corporate media  shills for the Establishment and peddles vaccine injections for the public rejecting any trepidation about the jabs       So  what can we make of this controversy  It is a fact that vaccine pamphlet inserts state that their product can cause a litany of side effects  including autism despite what CNN s Dr  Gupta says  I propose that when we look at vaccines we should use the same approach most people take when they decide what food and drink enters their body  After all  an injection enables many ingredients to enter the body and yet  for the most part  people take vaccines on blind faith  They have no idea what s in the shot and the  faithfully blind  usually don t even notice when later it s admitted a particular vaccine isn t effective  From this angle  I

Column<b'f(            Hamish  a contributor  remarks on how we are encouraged to examine what is in our food but criminalized for rejecting the cocktail of toxins contained in vaccines                       By Hamish   henrymakow com       The Establishment media has reported that there is a growing  anti vax  movement such an uptick in opposition to vaccines that the moniker  anti vaxxers  has entered the modern lexicon       In Ontario  school boards have warned parents  to update their kids  immunization records or face suspension   The provincial legislature has produced legislation that  would require anti vax parents to take an  education session  essentially a re education brainwash  The authoritarian posturing by the Establishment produces a societal chilling effect  people who either refuse vaccines or denounce them are ostracized by society and this kind of systematic shunning is a worldwide trend       In Australia  there is a  vaccine crackdown  announcing an end to religious exemptions and decreeing that  doctors will be given incentive payments so that parents stick to their children s vaccination schedule   In poorer countries  organizations like The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  the world s largest private foundation with assets in the billions  distributes vaccines to millions  Adverse consequences are rarely headlined       Major media outlets censure any expos\\xc3\\xa9 exploring the possibility of vaccine damage and corrupt Establishment collusion like the film Vaxxed  written and directed by Dr  Andrew Wakefield  that was pulled from the Tribeca Film Festival  Celebrity Hollywood stars are scorned like Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy for expressing concerns about vaccine safety  Even Donald Trump has stated that vaccines are  not helpful  and in turn has been ridiculed by the corporate media  Of course  Dr  Oz  the darling of that same corporate media  shills for the Establishment and peddles vaccine injections for the public rejecting any trepidation about the jabs       So  what can we make of this controversy  It is a fact that vaccine pamphlet inserts state that their product can cause a litany of side effects  including autism despite what CNN s Dr  Gupta says  I propose that when we look at vaccines we should use the same approach most people take when they decide what food and drink enters their body  After all  an injection enables many ingredients to enter the body and yet  for the most part  people take vaccines on blind faith  They have no idea what s in the shot and the  faithfully blind  usually don t even notice when later it s admitted a particular vaccine isn t effective  From this angle  I present some observations made by author Liam Scheff in his book Official Stories  2012    WHAT IS IN A VACCINE   The term  vaccination  comes from the Latin word  vacca   We could call it cow injection  to be true to history  because  and we re never really told this  but the vaccine that made it all famous smallpox came from the sores on the underbellies and legs of cows and horses  Pus and blood were scraped off  put on the ends of small  sharp pronged forks or lancets and jabbed into people s arms  Yes   vacca  means  cow   Does that surprise you  Did we really think that animal blood and pus was a good thing to put into our bodies  Vaccines are regarded as a nearly magical process  like a totem or a crucible  a station of the cross in the Western world  it has replaced baptism as a holy rite  Those who are opposed are mistrusted and feared  almost as witches  certainly as troubled heretics  But no one ever asks the question  what is in a vaccine       Vaccines are not conjured at Hogwarts by honest wizards  Willy Wonka doesn t brew them in his chocolate factory  They are not magical and there is a reason  or many  why some people oppose them so strongly  Vaccines are toxic  by their very nature  The liquid in the syringe is filled with very small pieces of
